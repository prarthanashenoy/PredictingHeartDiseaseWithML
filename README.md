# Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. Early detection of heart disease is crucial for effective intervention and management. This project explores various machine learning techniques to build a predictive model using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

## 1. Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in improving patient outcomes.  This project focuses on developing and comparing different machine learning models to accurately predict heart disease based on patient attributes.

## 2. Machine Learning Techniques

The project explores three different machine learning algorithms for classification:

* **Logistic Regression:** A statistical model used for binary classification.  It predicts the probability of an event occurring, in this case, the presence of heart disease.

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**  A simple algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.  Distance metrics such as Euclidean and Manhattan distance are used to determine proximity.

* **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.  It is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

The dataset obtained from Kaggle is preprocessed before training the models. This involves the following steps:

* **Handling Missing Values:** Addressing any missing data in the dataset through imputation or removal.

* **Feature Scaling:** Standardizing or normalizing the features to ensure that they have a similar range of values, preventing features with larger values from dominating the model.

* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.  Typically, a split ratio of 80% for training and 20% for testing is used.

## 4. Model Training and Evaluation

Each machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed training data.  The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics, including:

* **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.

* **Precision:**  The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. It measures the accuracy of positive predictions.

* **Recall:**  The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It measures the ability of the model to identify all positive instances.

* **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

* **Confusion Matrix:** A table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

* **Cross-Validation:** A technique used to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the training data to ensure its robustness and generalizability.

## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the performance of the selected models. Grid search and randomized search are employed to find the best combination of hyperparameters for each model.

## 6. Model Selection and Deployment

The model with the best performance based on the evaluation metrics and cross-validation results is selected as the final model.  This model can be deployed to predict the likelihood of heart disease for new patients.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for heart disease prediction. The project can be extended by incorporating additional features, exploring other machine learning algorithms, and deploying the model as a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.  Integrating real-time data from wearable sensors could further enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
